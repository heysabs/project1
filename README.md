#EKANSEECLEARLYNOW: A Pokemon-themed game of Snakes & Ladders

Pikachu and Charmander are racing to the top of the game board!

You need to be wary of the ekans-infested terrain, though: an ekans attack
will set you back by up to 40 spaces!

On the bright side, friendly drifblims are also lurking around the forest -
if you're nice to them, you may hitch a ride towards the top!

##Game play:
* 2 player turn-based game
* Player rolls the dice to determine number of moves to make
  - If player lands on an ekans (snake), player moves back by X spaces
  - If player lands on a drifblim (balloon-like thing), player moves forward by X spaces
* First player to reach 100 wins (and game is reset)

##Stacks:
* HTML, CSS and JS
